This does a simple AWK for Nokia NSP formatted NE exported .csv files, unfortunately I do not have API access to auto-update my hostfile so I have to manually export a NE list from NFMP/NSP every week and update my local hostfile. I built this mainly beause NSP fails sometimes so if I at least have a local copy of the NE.csv file I can parse it to get crucial NE details and still login and troubleshoot through CLI.
